This project are lua scripts for compputer craft turtles that I have been working on as I finish and validate the scripts.
So far I have one script that is somewhat functional it justt needs some bug fixes.

----------Debug-Tools---------
These lua scripts do work and can help you when designing your own scripts.

the Block-Check.lua script scans the block that the turtle is facing and gives the user some usefull information
about the block. Make sure that the block is in front of the turtle to get a successfull scan.

The Inv-Check.lua script scans each item in the turtles inventory and returns information about each item.
It does have a one second delay between scanning of the items to allow the user to read them.
