This project are lua scripts for computer craft turtles that I have been working on as I finish and validate the scripts.
So far I have one script that is somewhat functional it just needs some bug fixes.

----------Debug-Tools---------
These lua scripts do work and can help you when designing your own scripts.

the Block-Check.lua script scans the block that the turtle is facing and gives the user some use full information
about the block. Make sure that the block is in front of the turtle to get a success full scan.

The Inv-Check.lua script scans each item in the turtles inventory and returns information about each item.
It does have a one second delay between scanning of the items to allow the user to read them.


-----------Farming----------------
In this category of scripts I have agricultural farming such as sugarcane and in the future hopefully to have some
food farming scripts as well.

--sugarcane farm script------------
This script is now in a functional state and is set to automatically harvest sugarcane every 15 minutes. To get this script to
work you will need to plant your sugarcane in a line. Next place the turtle with the script installed on the right hand side from
facing the sugarcane. make sure the turtle is facing the sugarcane block at floor level and a chest is placed directly behind it.
